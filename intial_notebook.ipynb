      "Socrates was a philosopher who lived in Athens during the 5th century BCE and is considered the father of Western philosophy. He is famous for his method of inquiry known as the Socratic Method, which involved questioning others to stimulate critical thinking and the search for truth. Although Socrates left no written works behind, his ideas and teachings were passed down through his disciple, Plato. Socrates believed that wisdom came from acknowledging one's own ignorance and engaging in open dialogue with others. His commitment to truth and ethical conduct ultimately led to his trial and execution.\n"
